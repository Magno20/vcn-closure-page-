                                    As you all know VCN is one of the oldest known Minecraft Servers running for almost 7 years! This is a very long time. VCN and Minecraft have meant so much to me and I have met some great people and built a community with the most passionate Minecraft players!
                                    <br />

                            <h5 class="is-5">VERY Short Story</h5>
                            <p>
                                    <strong>2012-2014:</strong>
                                    Village Craft was created as a small server just for close friends to play. It wasn't until we decided to open up the server to the public it got its name. 

                                    This was the prime of Minecraft and Village Craft's history. 
                        

                                    The biggest player count recorded was 64 players, during the VC3 map!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    <strong>2015 - 2016:</strong>
                                     There were two maps refreshes known as VC5, VC6 and VC7.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    <strong>2016 - 2019:</strong>
                                    VC8 was to be the last planned map for VCN and this has come true. This is our longest ever running map. With regular care from staff players, it has been the best map we’ve ever had with the least amount of griefs.
                            </p>

                            <h5 class="is-5">FAQ</h5>
                            <h6 class="is-6" style="line-height: 20px;">I hope I have answered most of your questions!</h6>
                            <p>
                                    <strong>Why do you have to close!?</strong>
                                    This is a difficult question! I have been managing VCN for 7 years and it takes a lot of time and energy to maintain the server. VCN has been going for a very long time and I don’t have enough dedicated time to keep VCN to the standard that everyone loves. 7 years have gone quick! I never expected to keep doing VCN for 7 years. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                      <strong>When will the server close?</strong>
                                      I will keep the server online for 1 MONTH giving everyone the time to take screenshots of beloved towns and cities (This is heartbreaking for me to write). I know how much effort you have all put into building towns.<strong> Official Closure date: Friday, 15th March 2019.</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                        <strong>What will happen to the maps?</strong>
                                        The server will close meaning the maps will NOT be accessible to anyone.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                        <strong>Can I get a copy of the map?</strong>
                                        I’m afraid I am not going to give the maps or files to anyone or for a cost. I don’t want any “Village Craft Network” clones being made. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                        <strong>Can I somehow get my town or buildings?</strong>
                                        I’m very sorry, but due to the large requests from players, this will be very hard to maintain. Sadly this won’t happen.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                        <strong>What about my lifetime rank or items?</strong>
                                        Lifetime ranks and items were advertised to be the lifetime of the server. If you have further questions please contact _Magno20_ through <a href="mailto:info@village-craft.net">Email</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                        <strong>Can I download my artmap paintings?</strong>
                                        There is no feature that allows exporting. I suggest standing in front of the painting and screenshot it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                        <strong>I am Banned/Muted can I come back?</strong>
                                        Nope, you have been banned or muted for a reason.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                        <strong>Can I buy Village Craft Network and own the rights?</strong>
                                        Nope. I don't want clones of the server. Make your own server and start with a brand new idea!
